## Hydra
* Implement a sequential hacking technique for starting game
* Create a warmup target routine to be able afterward to compute the real max ram of a pServ to hack this server.
* Deploy malware as soon as a server has been upgraded
* Cleanup code
* => strategy 50% or 5% ?

## Jarvis
* Integrate hydra
* Implement logic to adapt hacking based on RAM and availability

## Sherlock
* fix bugs

## Misc.
* ValueObject (mapstruct)
* Automapper
* TypeScript
* Factory to initialize adapters
* IDE back 

## Doc
* Hydra (builder Servers) -> Shiva (Compute **previsions**) -> leecher (launch malwares) -> HWGW 

## Unit testing
* Setup a unit testing framework on JS
** Jest + https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-cucumber

* https://cypress.io/ ??
* NightwatchJS ??
    
## Map network in a log window
* Live update network on external pop (with servers internal values)

# Market automation
* Dump price variation on typical stock to analyse price fluctuations
* Simulate a portfolio and positions... => diversification
